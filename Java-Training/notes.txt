Workflow of java code => Code -> compiler -> byte code -> JVM(JIT + Interpreter) -> binary code
Java is a high level language which is easily readable, understandable and instructable by programmer.
It is platform independent, because in java source code is converted into byte code which is easily executable in any platform which has JVM.
JVM - JVM stands for java virtual machine. It does not exists physically. It is used to convert byte code into binary code. It consists of JIT and Interpreter.
JRE - JRE stands for java runtime environment. It exists physically. It is used to provide environment to run the java program.
JDK - JDK stands for java development kit. It exists physically. It provides an environment to run as well as to develop a java program.

# Printing statements
System.out.print(); -> After printing the data the cursor is shifted to next position in same line.
System.out.println(); -> After printing the data the cursor is shifted to next position in new line.

# TOKENS:- The smallest part of java program
Types:-
1. Keywords:- Words with predefined meaning. 
              It is also known as compiler aware words. 
              They should always be in lowercase. 
              In java we have 50+ keywords(eg:- class, public, static, void).

2. Identifier:- The name given by programmer. (cannot use keyword or space, should not start with number, special characters are not allowed except _ and $) (eg:- class name, variable name, method names, package name)

3. Literals:- The value or data given by programmer.
Types:-
1.Number:- Integer and Floating number.

2.Character:- It is used to represent a single data. 
              It is enclosed inside single quotes.
              Length of character literal is one. 
              It can have lowercase, uppercase, single digits, all type of special characters.

3.String: - It is used to represent group of characters. 
            It is enclosed inside double quotes. 
            The length of string literal can br anything

4.Boolean - It gives us only 2 values, either true or false.

4.Separators:- To Separate java members.
Types:- 
{} - to separate block
() - separate equations, method declaration, write conditions
; - end of statement
, - separate variables
. - reference

# DataTypes:- What type of data we are storing inside any variable
1. Primitive:- Inbuilt datatype, have fixed size. (byte,short,int,long | float,double | char | boolean)
2. Non-Primitive:- Does not have fixed size. (string,classname,arrays)

# Types of variables:-
1. Based on datatype:- 1. Primitive
                       2. Non- Primitive

2. Based on scope:- 1. Local variable(declared in local area or method area)
                    2. Global variable(declared in class area or global)

static variable:- A varivable which is declared inside class or global area prefixed with static keyword.
non static variable: - A varible which is declared inside class or global area without static keyword.

local varibable:- A variable which is declared inside local area. 
                  We cannot use local variables without initialisation. 
                  Local variables are not assigned with default values.
                  We cannot create two local variables with same name.
                  local varible can be used only inside same local area.

Gloal variables: - We can use global variables inside global as well as local area.
